Add a page sidebar when using the Twenty Seventeen theme

== Description ==

Twenty Seventeen is the official WordPress theme in 2017 and it's really awesome, but unfortunately it has no way to display a sidebar on pages :(
Let's fix that.

= Sidebar on all the pages =

This tiny plugin will add the Blog Sidebar to all the pages, including the front page! You don't have to touch a single line of code, and it works for Twenty Seventeen child themes too.

For best results, go to *Customize > Theme Options* and set **Page Layout** to **One Column**.

= Sidebar on individual pages =

If you want your page sidebar to differ from your post sidebar, it is recommended to install Content Aware Sidebars. That plugin allows you to show and hide widget areas on a wide range of conditions, giving you complete control over your sidebar.

== Installation ==

1. Navigate to 'Plugins > Add New'
1. Search for 'page sidebar for twentyseventeen'
1. Install and activate the plugin
1. That's it! Blog Sidebar will now be displayed on all pages

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this plugin work with my theme? =

This plugin only works for the Twenty Seventeen theme and its child themes. Try installing it while using another theme, and you'll see it do... nothing at all.

= How to show/hide a different sidebar on pages? =

This plugin adds the Blog Sidebar to all pages. If you want to display or hide different sidebars on different pages, we recommend installing Content Aware Sidebars.
